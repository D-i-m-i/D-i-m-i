Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After working as a Mechanical Engineer for 6 years I decided to make a big career change into Full Stack development. With a strong understanding of coding concepts both in the back-end and the front-end realms, I cannot wait to help teams bring ambitious projects to life.
 
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a couple of cool ideas
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects as a full-stack developer

ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimi/ OR demetristz@outlook.com 

âš¡ Fun fact: Comfortable stepping outside my comfort zone
