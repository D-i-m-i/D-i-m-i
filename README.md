Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After working as a Mechanical Engineer for 6 years I decided to make a big career change into Full Stack development. With a strong understanding of coding concepts both in the back-end and the front-end realms, I cannot wait to help teams bring ambitious projects to life.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently looking to collaborate on interesting projects as a full-stack developer
